# puzzle-sources
Javascript source codes for games at puzzlopia.

These sources are the original sources used at [puzzlopia](http://www.puzzlopia.com). By now they cannot be run locally because they rely
on an external 'player' object among others.

I hope to be able to add all required objects in order for these sources to be executable locally.
